    <h2>Together to Your Home</h2>
    <p>The Mutual Support Platform is a place where people unite to help each other achieve one important goal — having their own home. Every contribution brings someone closer to their dream.</p>

    <div class="actions">

<!-- ABOUT -->
<section id="about" class="section">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <hr>

    <p><strong>The Mutual Support Platform</strong> was created for people who work hard but still cannot afford to buy a home on their own. Here, participants make small voluntary contributions — <strong>10€</strong>, <strong>50€</strong>, or <strong>100€</strong> — and the collected funds help people reach their housing goals: an apartment, a house, a plot of land, a cottage, or other housing-related needs.</p>

    <p>After receiving support, participants remain in the project, helping the next ones. Everything is voluntary, transparent, and honest: funds movement and the participant queue are visible on the website.</p>

    <p><strong>Platform commission</strong> is small and used only for development: stable site operation, security, user support, and transparency tools.</p>

<!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
<section id="how" class="section">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <hr>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Contribution.</strong> You make a voluntary contribution — 10€, 50€, or 100€.</li>
      <li><strong>Queue.</strong> Funds are distributed through a transparent queue.</li>
      <li><strong>Support.</strong> One participant receives support for their housing goal.</li>
      <li><strong>Continuity.</strong> After receiving help, you stay and support the next participants.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Why It Works</h2>
    <hr>

    <p>Saving for a home alone can take years or may even be impossible. When people unite, small contributions create a real impact. Transparency, simplicity, and consistency make this system work.</p>
