      <p class="section-intro">Answers to the most common questions about <strong>Natalia Help Project</strong> 🌿</p>

      <details class="faq-item" open>
        <summary>Why did I create this project?</summary>
        <p>I started working at 16. I had no inheritance, no home of my own. I know what it means to work hard and still struggle to feel secure. There are millions like me. This project isn’t about pity — it’s about hope and mutual support. A place where everyone can breathe easier and know they are not alone. 💚</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Is this charity or begging?</summary>
        <p>This is mutual support, not charity. No one is asking — everyone is participating. It’s an honest circle of trust: today you help others, tomorrow others help you. No middlemen, no illusions — just people and kindness. 🌿</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Where does the money go?</summary>
        <p>All contributions go into a shared fund. Each month a portion is distributed in order, and part is saved in reserve to ensure stability. Everything is recorded and visible to participants.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Can I stay anonymous?</summary>
        <p>Yes. Stories and personal details are shared only with consent. Everything here is voluntary and honest. Respect for privacy is essential.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Why is transparency so important?</summary>
        <p>Because trust is the foundation. Everyone deserves to know where each euro goes. Transparency builds confidence and keeps the project fair for all.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>How can I help if I’m not participating?</summary>
        <p>You can tell your friends, share the link, contribute €1, or just spread the message. Even a small act can make a big difference. 💫</p>
