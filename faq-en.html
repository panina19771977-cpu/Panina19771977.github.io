      <h4>1. What is the Mutual Support Platform?</h4>
      <p>It is a voluntary community where people help each other achieve one major goal —  
      getting their own home: an apartment, a house, land, or a summer cottage.  
      It is not a bank, loan service, or investment scheme.</p>

      <h4>2. Who is this project for?</h4>
      <p>For people who work for years but still cannot save enough for housing.  
      For those who did not inherit property or receive financial help.  
      For those who want honest, transparent support from people in the same situation.</p>

      <h4>3. How does the system work?</h4>
      <p>You make a voluntary contribution — 10€, 50€, or 100€.  
      Funds are distributed through an open queue.  
      One participant receives support, and everyone else moves forward.  
      After receiving help, you stay and support others.</p>

      <h4>4. Why is this system fair?</h4>
      <p>Because:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the queue is public;</li>
        <li>reports are visible;</li>
        <li>the commission is only for platform maintenance;</li>
        <li>participants stay after receiving help;</li>
        <li>no promises of profit or unrealistic expectations.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>5. What contribution amounts are available?</h4>
      <p>Voluntary contributions of <strong>10€, 50€, or 100€</strong>.</p>

      <h4>6. Why these amounts?</h4>
      <p>They are affordable for most people.  
      Small contributions from many people create real strength.</p>

      <h4>7. What happens after receiving support?</h4>
      <p>You remain part of the platform and help the next participants.  
      This creates a continuous circle of support.</p>

      <h4>8. What goals can be funded?</h4>
      <p>Only housing-related goals: apartment, house, land, cottage, renovation,  
      or initial mortgage payment.</p>

      <h4>9. Can I donate without joining?</h4>
      <p>Yes. Anyone can make a donation to support participants.</p>

      <h4>10. How does the project generate support?</h4>
      <p>Through large numbers of participants making small contributions.  
      One person cannot help everyone — but thousands of people can.</p>

      <h4>11. How is the queue formed?</h4>
      <p>By submission time, participation activity, and confirmed contributions.</p>

      <h4>12. How transparent is everything?</h4>
      <p>The queue and reports are public.  
      Nothing is hidden or manipulated.</p>

      <h4>13. What is the platform commission?</h4>
      <p>A small amount used only for hosting, technical maintenance, security, and development.</p>

      <h4>14. How much is the commission?</h4>
      <p>Minimal. The exact number is shown in the reports section.</p>

      <h4>15. Is support guaranteed?</h4>
      <p>The queue moves steadily, but speed depends on the number of participants and donations.</p>

      <h4>16. How will I know when it's my turn?</h4>
      <p>You will see it in the participants’ table and receive a notification.</p>

      <h4>17. Can I leave the project?</h4>
      <p>Yes. Participation is fully voluntary.</p>

      <h4>18. Do I have to participate every month?</h4>
      <p>No. But regular contributions help the queue move faster.</p>

      <h4>19. Are there age limits?</h4>
      <p>Yes — 18+.</p>

      <h4>20. Why should I share the link with others?</h4>
      <p>Because more people means faster progress for everyone.</p>

      <h4>21. Why is this a private initiative?</h4>
      <p>Because the project was created from real life needs, not bureaucracy.  
      A person like you needed help — and created a platform for others.</p>

      <h4>22. Is this a scam?</h4>
      <p>No. Transparency, open queue, visible reports, and small voluntary contributions  
      exclude any fraudulent nature.</p>

      <h4>23. Why do people stay after receiving help?</h4>
      <p>Because it is fair — the circle must continue.  
      Everyone gets their turn.</p>

      <h4>24. Should I trust this project?</h4>
      <p>Only if you believe in transparent, voluntary mutual support.  
      Nothing is forced.</p>

      <h4>25. How do I join?</h4>
      <p>Fill out a short form on the <a href="apply.html">Join</a> page.</p>

      <h4>26. Why can this change your life?</h4>
      <p>Because saving for housing alone is almost impossible —  
      but together it becomes realistic.</p>

      <h4>27. Can I start with the minimum amount?</h4>
      <p>Yes — you can start with a small contribution.</p>

      <h4>28. What should I do next?</h4>
      <p>Read → apply → contribute.</p>

      <h4>29. Can I view the queue without registering?</h4>
      <p>Yes. The queue is open to everyone.</p>

      <h4>30. Why is this project growing now?</h4>
      <p>Because thousands of people are tired of trying alone  
      and want a real chance to achieve housing.</p>
