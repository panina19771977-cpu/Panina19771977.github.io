    <h3>If You Are Reading This — It’s Not by Accident</h3>

    <p>Many people dream of having their own home. Not everyone was born into a wealthy family,
    not everyone received an apartment as a gift, and not everyone has financial support from relatives.
    Most people work for years — and still cannot save for housing.</p>

    <p>This platform was created for those people.  
    For those who work hard, take care of their families, pay bills, and still find it almost impossible
    to collect the required amount.</p>

    <p>The <strong>Mutual Support Platform</strong> exists for people like that — and for people like me.</p>

    <hr style="border:0;border-bottom:1px solid var(--gold);margin:40px auto;width:60%">

    <h3>Why This Project Was Created</h3>

    <p>I know exactly what it feels like to work for many years and still not be able to afford a home.
    And I know that thousands of people experience the same.</p>

    <p>That’s why I created a place where people can combine small voluntary contributions —
    <strong>10€, 50€, or 100€</strong> — and help each other move toward real housing goals:
    an apartment, a house, land, a cottage, or anything related to housing.</p>

    <p>This is not a loan.  
    This is not an investment.  
    This is not a financial product.  
    This is voluntary mutual support — simple, honest, transparent.</p>

    <hr style="border:0;border-bottom:1px solid var(--gold);margin:40px auto;width:60%">

    <h3>How It Works</h3>

    <p>Everyone joins a single queue.  
    As contributions and donations accumulate, one participant receives support based on their housing goal.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>All contributions are voluntary.</li>
      <li>Amounts are small and accessible.</li>
      <li>After receiving support, participants remain in the project.</li>
      <li>The queue is public and transparent.</li>
      <li>A small commission is used only for the platform's development.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This creates a circle of support.  
    Today you help someone — tomorrow someone helps you.</p>

    <hr style="border:0;border-bottom:1px solid var(--gold);margin:40px auto;width:60%">

    <h3>If You Have Doubts — Start Small</h3>

    <p>No pressure.  
    No obligations.  
    Everything here is based on goodwill and honest participation.</p>

    <p>You can start with the minimum amount, watch the queue move,
    and see that everything is real, open, and working.</p>

    <h3>Join Us</h3>

    <p>If you’ve dreamed of having your own home but couldn’t reach it alone —  
    you are not alone. Many people are in the same situation.</p>

    <p>And together, we can achieve what’s impossible individually.</p>
