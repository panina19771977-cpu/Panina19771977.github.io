# Mutual Support Platform — Official Project Description

## 1. Project Overview
The Mutual Support Platform is a structured community-based system designed to help individuals achieve housing-related goals. Participants contribute voluntary amounts (10€, 50€, 100€), and collected funds are allocated to one participant at a time following a transparent queue. The platform operates on the principle of continuous mutual support: participants remain in the project after receiving assistance to support subsequent members.

## 2. Purpose
The platform aims to provide a clear and transparent model of voluntary financial participation for individuals who:
- are unable to accumulate savings for housing on their own,
- lack family or external financial support,
- seek a structured community-based solution,
- want transparency and clarity in all fund movements.
The project supports exclusively housing-related needs.

## 3. Participation Model
1. The participant submits an application specifying their housing goal.
2. The participant makes a voluntary contribution (10€, 50€, or 100€).
3. The participant is added to the public queue.
4. Funds are distributed to participants in accordance with their position.
5. After receiving support, the participant remains in the system to assist others.
This ensures a sustainable model based on continuous voluntary contributions.
